<h1>Synchronous Source</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
A synchronous dataset contains a timestamp within its path to identify its creation date. 
Synchronous Source is a node used to retrieve data, from a synchronous data set, that will be used in a moving window scheduled process. 
Red Sqirl supports two types of data storage for synchronous data-set: HCatalog and HDFS.
</p>


<p>
<ul>
    <li>Inputs - No Inputs</li>
    <li>DataType - Select the Data Storage (HDFS, HCatalog...)</li>
    <li>SubType - Select the Data Format (Text Format, Compressed Format...)</li>
    <li>Browser - Select a path, Change the Header</li>
    <li>Template: define a template path</li>
    <li>Occurrence: Define the frequency of the data</li>
    <li>Outputs - The template path as well as the real path of the initial dataset</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a href="../helpimages/DataType.png" target="_blank" id="page1">Source Data Type</a></h2>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>In Storage, the user can select where the data that will be used is stored. Only HCatalog and HDFS data type are supported.</p>

<h2><a id="page2">Source Data Sub-Type</a></h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>The data sub-type defines the format of the user’s data.</p>

<h2><a id="page3">Source: Browser</a></h2>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>
Within the dataset browser the user can select the path of the data that will be used.
</p>

<h3>Data format parameters</h3>
<p>
The user can change the delimiter. The delimiter can be a normal character (",","|",";") or an ASCII character in which case (#1, #44).
</p>

<h3>Data preview (HDFS Only)</h3>
<p>
The user can change the header and fields of a file by clicking on the pencil Icon. 
A header can be a list of feature names or a list of feature name with type. For example, 
if I have a data set that contains three fields. I could defined the header to be 
"field1, field2, field3" or "field1 DATE, field2 STRING, field3 INT".
</p>

<h2><a id="page4">Template</a></h2>
<h3>path</h3>
<p>
The user can define here what are the parts of the user’s path that make up the timestamp. 
The user will be able to use the following variables:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>${YEAR}</li>
    <li>${MONTH}</li>
    <li>${DAY}</li>
    <li>${HOUR}</li>
    <li>${MINUTE}</li>
</ul>

<p>
Example: <br/>
The original path may read: /twitter/tweets/dt=2017-10-14;hr=23 <br/>
The revised template path should be changed to: <br/>
/twitter/tweets/dt=${YEAR}-${MONTH}-${DAY};hr=${HOUR}
</p>

<h2><a id="page5">Path Selection</a></h2>

<p>
In here the user will be able to define the frequency of the user's dataset, and the one the user needs for the user's analyses.
</p>

<h3>Unit</h3>
<p>
The time unit used for the following fields. 
</p>

<h3>Time Unit</h3>
<p>The amount of units between every run.</p>
<p>
Example: <br/>
If the unit selected is HOUR, a 1 in this field would mean to run every hour; whereas a 2 in this field would mean to run every 2 hours.
</p>

<h3>Number of instances</h3>
<p>
The number of the most recent captures to be used in the user’s end analysis.
</p>
<p>
Example: <br/>
If you put in 24 number of instances with a frequency of an hour then you are asking the system to use 24 hours worth of data in 
the following actions.
</p>

<h3>Offset</h3>
<p>
Offset is used when the incoming data is being processed at a time different from when it is received.
</p>
<p>
Example: <br/>
Your data from 8 am is set to process at 9 am. In order for the system to understand this lag you would set the offset to -1 
(if your units are in hours this means 1 hour earlier).
</p>

<h2><a id="page6">Scheduling</a></h2>
<p>
Please note that Synchronous Source runs default on the timestamp defined by the data set. 
E.g if the dataset is daily timestamped,the sync will run everyday and pull in the most recent data set each day. 
In order to change the frequency of the sync and also define a particular time for the sync to occur please update the scheduling. 
For further details on how to scheduling please follow the below link.
