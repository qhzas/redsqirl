	<h1>Models</h1>

	<p>The model view gathers all the models installed on the user's Red Sqirl instance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Models are data process blocks built from Red Sqirl packages. A model can produce a prediction, a report or an analysis. A model is composed of Super Actions that depend on each other.
   </p>

	<h2>Scope</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
	    <li>System: The system scope is available to all the users.</li>
	    <li>User: The user scope allow the installation of extra personal
	    functionality.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The User scope models always overwrite the System models in case of conflict. For example, if churn_model with a Super Action evaluation is installed on the System scope model and the user has installed Version 2 on the User scope model that does not have the Super Action  evaluation, the user won't be able to access the Super Action  evaluation.</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<p>System models can only be installed by an administrator. The user needs to be in the required 
	<a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_setting" onclick="return false;" href="../help/setting.html">setting</a> to be able to install models. New models can be installed either from the the Analytics Store or from HDFS.</p>

	<h3>Analytics Store</h3>

	<p>The user can only access the Analytics Store provided the web server can access the store. 
	<ol>
	    <li>Click Install either in the System scope column or User Scope
	    column</li>
	    <li>Sign In with web credentials, if the user does not have an account, one can be created on the spot.</li>
	    <li>Identify the package to be installed.</li>
	    <li>Click install</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>From HDFS</h3>

	<p>A model is a simple zip file that should have a name
	$name-$version.zip</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Click import either in the System scope column or User Scope
	    column</li>
	    <li>Choose the HDFS path in which your model exist</li>
	    <li>Click OK</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Model Privileges</h2>

	<p>Three permissions exists for a model:
	<ul>
	    <li>no privilege: Anyone can view and modify the source</li>
	    <li>run only: The version installed is neither viewable or editable</li>
        <li>licensed: Same as above, but enforces the installation through the web</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Run and edit privileges can be set when the user exports the model to HDFS. When the user does so, it is highly recommended to keep the original as a copy, as it can not modified. </li>
    </p>

	<h2>Model Manipulation</h2>

	<p>Models can be modified provided they do not have any permissions assigned to them.</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>Create: Create a new model by clicking on the new button</li>
        <li>Protected: Protect a model so it can not be modified</li>
	    <li>Remove: Remove a model. Once a model is removed, it can not be undone.</li>
	    <li>Export: Export the model to HDFS in a given folder i.e $model-$version.zip</li>
	    <li>In the edit window the user can:
	    <ul>
	    <li>Set an image: you can give an image to your model by clicking
	    the <img src="../image/icons/button-pencil.gif" style="width:15px;margin:0px"/> right next to it. The image has to be gif, square and between 40x40 and 75x75. By signing out and back in can solve the problem of browser caching.</li>
	    <li>Rename: Rename a model by clicking the <img src="../image/icons/button-pencil.gif" style="width:15px;margin:0px"/> right next to its
	    name.</li>
	    <li>Change Version: Change the version by clicking the <img src="../image/icons/button-pencil.gif" style="width:15px;margin:0px"/> right
	    next to the current version.</li>
	    <li>Comment: Comments can be added to guide future users about the model.</li>
	    <li>Copy/Move: Comments can be added to guide future users about the model.</li>
	    <li>Set to public/private: The user can define public interfaces. Only public interfaces can be added to the footer.</li>
	    <li>Remove: Remove a Super Action from a model, this action cannot be undone.</li>
	    </ul></li>
	</ul>
